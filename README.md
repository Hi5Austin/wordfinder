1/ YOU NEED A WORDNIK API KEY, go get one then insert it into the code where you it says "YOUR WORDNIK API KEY"
2/ Run the script in the terminal
3/ type the list of words you'd like to define with "," as a delimiter 
   Example: 
       > ruby worddefiner.rb
       > cat,dog,fork,glass
4/ This will return the word followed by it's defintion followed some weird API url stuff I'm unsure about.
